I think Zen Garden is an iteresting website as it shows differnt ways multiple layers of css code can alter and improve the base look of a website.  All the designs are unique and have their own feel allowing for website creators to create a mood that fits the theme of their site.  

I design I really liked in the zen garden website was the steel style.  The background of a dark city soothed me which could be done through a css background insertion.  I also really liked the moving text boxes which was done with animation commands in CSS.
